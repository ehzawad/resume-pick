Overall quality is solid, with the leading candidate demonstrating strong alignment to core role requirements and the remaining candidates showing partial fit or gaps that may be addressable through targeted questioning.\n\nThe top-tier candidate stands out on relevant experience, skills alignment, and likely impact, while the other candidates offer some complementary strengths but also more pronounced risk areas. No major systemic bias concerns are evident from the limited pool size; however, representation is too small to draw robust diversity conclusions, so additional sourcing to broaden the pipeline is recommended.
