The overall pool includes a healthy mix of backgrounds and experiences, with several candidates bringing adjacent-industry expertise and transferable skills.\n\nThe top tier stands out for measurable impact in prior roles, clear communication of outcomes, and evidence of cross-functional collaboration. Trends across the pool include strong technical/functional capabilities but inconsistent depth in strategic thinking and stakeholder management. The bias review did not identify any explicit systemic bias in ranking logic, but there is a mild skew toward candidates from larger, well-known organizations, which should be monitored to avoid overlooking high-potential profiles from smaller or non-traditional backgrounds.",
